print("""Important Keywords:
* def -> for defining function
* for -> looping the fixed quantity of things
* while -> looping any no. of times
* print -> prints on the screen
* format -> string format
* import -> imports modules
* range(a,b) -> range of in integers in range of a,b
* if, elif, else -> conditional statements
* exit() -> exits the program
* break -> breaks the loop
* input -> input from the user
* assert -> checks whether statement is correct or wrong
            and throws assertion error if wrong
* class -> defines the class
* continue -> continue the loop terminating the present iteration
* del -> deletes the elements in the dictionary
* from -> commonly used during import
* global -> global variables
* not, or, and, True, False -> boolean operators
* as -> It can be used as alias or other name for further usage
* del -> deletes class, variable, dictionary, list, etc
* class -> creates the class
* try, except, finally -> try some code,
                        if error then except that error and give message
                        and finally this should anyway run
* raise -> to raise the error of our own by defining ourselves
* exec -> runs the string statements/block of code can be used with compile also
* eval -> runs the expression and gives the output can be used with compile also
* from -> only import specific methods from the module
* global -> we can't change the global variable in some function then we have to 
            use the keyword global
* in -> to check the item is there or not, while iterating using range for 'for' fn
* is -> test for two distinct objects, variables
* lambda -> lambda expression can take any number of arguments but only one expression
            can be used as ambigous function for short term use
* pass -> can be used as placeholder i.e.., we can fill it later but we can define 
            the function, class, etc
* with -> piece of code runs and closes the file or we can condense the three lines
            to two lines, etc
* yield -> Commonly used in generator, generator -> fn + field, code stops and gives the
            yield values and then continues i.e., it is not like return which returns 
            and stops but goes on
* map, filter -> map can be used for all list items as arguments for lambda fn to get output
                applied to all the items while filter can be used for all list items as 
                arguments for lambda fn but returns which of them follows a condition

print("""Escape Sequences:
\\\ -> backslash
\\n -> newline
\\t -> tab
\\v -> vertical space
\\a -> like a alert or bell while executing the statement
\\b -> backspace
\\' -> escape '
\\" -> escape "
\\f -> feed forward
\\r -> return catridge

print("""Old Print string statements (percent = %):
percents -> string
percentc -> character
percentd percenti -> integer
percente percentE -> exponential output in small and capital respectively
percentx percentX -> Hexadecimal output in small and capital respectively
percento -> Octal output
percentu -> Decimal unsigned output
percentf percentF -> float
percentg percentG -> percentf or percente which ever is small, respectively
percentr -> Repr format for finding error in the output""")

print("""Data Types:
string -> 'sai'
float -> 3.01452
int -> 3
list -> [1,2,3,4,5]
tuples -> (1,2,3,4,5)
dictionaries -> {\a:1,b:2,c:3\}
True, False -> boolean 
bytes -> b'sai' -> binary form of image, file, anything
None -> nothing
