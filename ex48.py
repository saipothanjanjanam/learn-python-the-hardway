        for the program to execute the statements i.e..,
        \nWe are making the inputs play, play the game, play on the same as input i.e.,
        program checks the keyword in the user input
        \nLet's prepare the game program and game has following keywords:
        These allowable keywords are also known as 'lexicon'
        • Direction words: north, south, east, west, down, up, left, right, back
        • Verbs: go, stop, kill, eat
        • Stop words: the, in, of, from, at, it
        • Nouns: door, bear, princess, cabinet
        • Numbers: any string of 0 through 9 characters 
        \nWe break the sentence into words then we make the lexicon pairs i.e..,
        ('typeofword','word')
        \nEx: \nfirst_word = ('verb', 'go')
                second_word = ('direction', 'north')
                third_word = ('direction', 'west')
                sentence = [first_word, second_word, third_word]
        
        """)
